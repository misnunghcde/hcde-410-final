## Project Summary
This project researches the correlation between historically low fertility rates, happiness indicators, and economic indicators in Korea. It further explores how these factors differ from demographic trends in Korea compared to other developed countries. Using data from the World Bank’s Fertility and Economic Indicators Dataset and the World Happiness Report, this study seeks to understand how economic stability and life satisfaction contribute to Korea’s low fertility. Methodologically, the analysis includes correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables and comparative analysis to place Korea’s data in a global context. The project presents results through time series graphs, correlation heatmaps, and comparison tables to show trends and impacts on Korea’s demographic challenges. This project shows Korea’s low fertility rate currently stands compared to other countries.
