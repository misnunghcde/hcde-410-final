    "# Motivation and problem statement\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Project overview\n",
    "The low birth rate problem is a social challenge many developed countries. It has an impact on the population structure and the sustainability of society. In particular, Korea has experienced rapid growth but has suffered from side effects. Korea has the lowest birth rate and the fastest rate of decline in the world, and various problems are rapidly emerging in multiple aspects, such as economic stability, social welfare, and individual quality of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "As a Korean studying in the United States, I have become more curious about the low birth rate problem of my home country, Korea. I have experienced various cultures and social systems. Through the opportunity to look at the situation in Korea from an international perspective, I have developed a deep curiosity about how the low birth rate problem in Korea differs from that of other countries and what creates these differences. Based on these diverse perspectives and my love for my home country. I want to understand the situation in Korea more deeply through this project.  I'd like to explore how Korea’s factors affect the birth rate and provide implications for the international community.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem statement\n",
    "This study explores the relationship between socioeconomic factors, especially the happiness index and major economic indicators, and the low birth rate in Korea. It aims to reveal how economic stability and life satisfaction can affect Korea's birth rate differently than other countries. The goal is to identify socioeconomic characteristics that can differentiate Korea's low birth rate from that of other developed countries, thereby suggesting the seriousness of the demographic challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "#### Economic Stability Hypothesis\n",
    "Economic stability will positively correlate with the birth rate in Korea. The greater the economic stability, the more positive family formation and child planning factors are expected to increase.\n",
    "#### Happiness Index Hypothesis\n",
    "If the happiness index or life satisfaction is high, the birth rate is also likely to increase. In other words, the higher the overall satisfaction with life in Korea, the more positive the effect on the birth rate. However, the correlation may be weaker than that of economic factors.\n",
    "#### Korean Hypothesis\n",
    "The combination of economic indicators and the happiness index in Korea will uniquely affect the birth rate decline. Due to certain economic and social factors, Korea is likely to show a more unique and serious aspect of the low birth rate problem compared to other advanced countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Related Work\n",
    "Eungyung Kim and Jee-Seon Yi’s study, “Determinants of Childbearing Intention in Korea: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,” analyzes the key factors influencing childbearing intentions in Korea.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Link:__ [Determinants of Fertility Intentions among South Koreans: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/14/10/939)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "#### 1. Economic Security as a Positive Influence\n",
    "\n",
    "This study mentioned that living expenses, housing, and education costs are barriers to family planning in Korea.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Social Support and Gender Roles in Family Life\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional gender roles have a strong influence in Korea. This study calls for policies that promote gender equality in parenting to better support families.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Personal Well-being\n",
    "\n",
    "High levels of stress are related to a lower birth rate. This reflects the difficulty of long working hours and high expectations in the workplace and home environment."
